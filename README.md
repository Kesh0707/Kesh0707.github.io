There is a growing disconnect between individuals and nutritional awareness, undermining their ability to make informed dietary choices, leading to a decreased quality of life.

Growing up as a South Asian I was raised to embrace my culture in all forms, with diet shaping a large part of it. Home cooked food will always hold a special place of comfort in each of our hearts, with the richness in spices and diversity of ingredients making it easy to overeat with extra portions. South Asians are now predisposed to diabetes and other major health conditions, in comparison to their racial counterparts, creating an imbalance in the community. 
This calls for the solution of a balanced approach, requiring a method of questioning of what we can add or subtract from our traditional dishes, allowing our diets to adapt alongside our bodies as our society evolves. By creating a solution tailored to Indian nutritional needs, there is an opportunity to improve public health outcomes, enhance quality of life, and celebrate the rich culinary heritage of India while fostering informed and sustainable eating practices.
