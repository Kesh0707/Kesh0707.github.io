        <h2>What Makes DesiDietPro Special?</h2>
        <p>DesiDietPro is designed for real people who enjoy real food. We know that in South Asian homes, a "katori" of dal or a "handful" of nuts is just as common as grams and calories. That's why we created a platform that works the way you do.</p>
